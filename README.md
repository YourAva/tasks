# Tasks 🗒️
This is a simple project that I did to teach me how C file handling works. It asks the user a few options on what they wish to do, view or make a task. Making a file allows the user to enter a title and description, making the file name the title the user provided. The read takes a title to look for and displays it in the terminal if it exists.

# Notes
I'm always looking for advice, if you wanna reach out to me and talk about how I can improve my code, reach out to my Discord... `Discord:avalikesbread_`
